Lead Conversion Prediction

Project Overview

This project aims to identify potential leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. By implementing a logistic regression model, we assign a lead score to each prospect, enabling the sales team to focus their efforts efficiently and increase the overall conversion rate. The current lead conversion rate of 30% is targeted to be improved to 80%.
